INTRODUCTION

This module gives notion XrandR support. This is a rough PoC prototype, it 
needs cleaning up.

On initialization it puts a Screen on each monitor. 

When a screen size change event is received the monitor size is updated.
(perhaps the Screen size is not updated - I cannot test this here)

INSTALLATION

        1. Edit Makefile to ensure TOPDIR points to your top-level notion source
           directory with a system.mk that matches the version of notion installed
           on your system.

        2. Run make.

        3. Either run (as root)
                # make install
           or (as yourself),
                $ mkdir -p ~/.ion3/lib
                $ cp .libs/mod_xrandr.* ~/.notion/lib
        4. Add dopath("mod_xrandr") to ~/.notion/cfg_notion.lua. 
        5. (Re)start Notion.
		

LIMITATIONS

Screens should be updated when change events are received. Contents of screens
that have disappeared should be added to remaining screens (and perhaps 
restored when the original screen re-appears)
